# Customer Feedback Call - TechCorp Inc.

**Date:** January 9, 2026
**Company:** TechCorp Inc. 
**Participants:** Jennifer Liu (CTO), Marcus Washington (DevOps Lead)
**GitHub Team:** Sarah Chen, Kelly Park

## Company Background
- B2B SaaS company, 250 employees
- Engineering team: 45 developers
- Currently using Jenkins + manual deployment processes
- Pain point: Deployments taking 3-4 hours, frequent rollbacks

## Current Challenges

### Deployment Speed
- "Our deployments are killing us.  3-4 hours for a production push is unacceptable."
- Developers waiting around for deployments to complete
- Costs ~$5,000/week in lost productivity (Marcus's estimate)

### Reliability Issues
- 30% rollback rate on deployments
- Manual processes prone to human error
- No good visibility into what went wrong when things fail

### Tool Complexity
- "We have 7 different tools in our deployment pipeline"
- Engineers spend more time managing tools than building features
- Onboarding new engineers takes 2-3 weeks just for deployment training

## What They Loved
- "The AI-powered automation sounds like exactly what we need"
- Integration with existing tools is a huge selling point
- Dashboard looks clean and intuitive
- "If this can cut our deployment time in half, it pays for itself in 2 months"

## Concerns & Questions
1. **Security**: How is the AI trained?  Can it access our code?
2. **Migration**: How long does implementation take?
3. **Learning curve**: Will our team need extensive training?
4. **Cost**: What's the ROI timeline?

## Feedback on Messaging
- "Don't bury the 30% faster claim - lead with that!"

## Next Steps

- Proposal: 30-day pilot program
