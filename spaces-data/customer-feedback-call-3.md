# Customer Feedback Call - MegaCorp Enterprises

**Date:** January 21, 2026
**Company:** MegaCorp Enterprises
**Participants:** David Thompson (Director of Platform Engineering), Lisa Rodriguez (Security Lead), Chris Park (DevOps Manager)
**GitHub Team:** Sarah Chen, Kelly Park, Mike Johnson

## Company Background
- Enterprise software company, 2,500 employees
- Engineering team: 400+ developers across 8 global offices
- Currently using Jenkins, GitLab CI, and GitHub Actions (fragmented)
- Complex approval hierarchies and security requirements

## Current Challenges

### Tool Fragmentation
- "We have 3 different CI/CD systems.  Nobody knows which to use."
- Different business units bought different tools over the years
- No centralized visibility or governance
- David: "I can't even tell you how many deployments we do per day"

### Security & Governance
- 17 different approval workflows across the org
- Security reviews bottleneck everything
- Lisa: "We need to review every deployment, but we don't have enough people"
- Audit nightmares during compliance reviews

### Developer Experience
- Engineers frustrated by slow, complex processes
- High friction drives shadow IT behavior
- Talent retention issue:  "Modern devs don't want to work like it's 2015"
- Takes 2-3 months to fully onboard new engineers

## What They Loved
- AI-powered security scanning could reduce Lisa's team workload by 50%
- Unified dashboard would give David the visibility he desperately needs
- Standardization across the organization
- "Finally, a modern solution that doesn't sacrifice governance" - Lisa

## Concerns & Questions
1. **Enterprise Scale**: Can it handle 400+ developers, 50+ deployments/day?
2. **SSO & Security**:  SAML integration, role-based access control?
3. **Migration Strategy**: How do we migrate without disrupting 400 engineers?
4. **Cost**: Enterprise pricing for 400+ seats? 
5. **Support**: Need dedicated support team

## Feedback on Messaging
- "Enterprise customers care more about governance and security than speed"
- Want to see enterprise architecture diagrams
- Need ROI calculator for C-suite presentation
- Suggested reference architecture documentation
- Chris: "Show us how other large enterprises migrated successfully"

## Objections
- Massive migration risk - "we can't afford downtime"
- Change management across 400 engineers is daunting
- Existing tool contracts not up for renewal until Q4 2026
- Decision requires C-suite approval (6-9 month sales cycle)

## Next Steps
- Enterprise architecture review session (2 hours)
- Security deep-dive with Lisa's team
- Provide migration playbook and case studies
- Connect with account executive for enterprise pricing
- Schedule C-suite presentation for February

## Quotes
> "We're spending millions on a patchwork of tools. If we could consolidate to one modern platform, the ROI would be massive." - David

> "I need AI to help us review deployments. My team can't scale to match engineering growth." - Lisa

> "Our best engineers are leaving for companies with modern tooling. We need to catch up." - Chris

## Deal Potential
🟢 **VERY HIGH** - Massive opportunity, strong executive buy-in, clear ROI
💰 **Enterprise deal potential:  $500k+ annually**
⏰ **Timeline: Long sales cycle (6-9 months)**

## Internal Notes
- This could be a flagship customer
- Need to involve sales leadership
- Consider pilot program with one business unit first (100 devs)
- David has budget authority up to $250k, above that needs CFO approval
