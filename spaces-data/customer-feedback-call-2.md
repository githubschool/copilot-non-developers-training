# Customer Feedback Call - InnovateLabs

**Date:** January 14, 2026
**Company:** InnovateLabs
**Participants:** Raj Patel (VP Engineering), Sophie Chen (Senior DevOps Engineer)
**GitHub Team:** Sarah Chen, Tom Wilson

## Company Background
- FinTech startup, 120 employees
- Engineering team: 35 developers
- Using mix of CircleCI and custom scripts
- Growing fast - doubled engineering team in 6 months

## Current Challenges

### Scaling Problems
- "What worked for 15 developers doesn't work for 35"
- Deployment queue backing up during peak hours
- Different teams using different processes - chaos
- Sophie:  "I spend 60% of my time just answering deployment questions"

### Lack of Visibility
- Can't see who deployed what and when
- Hard to track down issues after deployments
- No centralized logging or monitoring
- "We're flying blind half the time" - Raj

### Compliance Requirements
- FinTech regulations require detailed audit trails
- Current setup doesn't provide compliance-ready logs
- Spent $15k on consulting to patch together audit solution
- Still not confident it meets all requirements

## What They Loved
- Centralized dashboard with full audit trail
- AI suggestions could help standardize processes across teams
- Built-in compliance features
- "This solves our scaling problem before it kills us" - Raj

## Concerns & Questions
1. **Compliance**: SOC 2 and PCI DSS compatibility?
2. **Customization**: Can we configure approval workflows?
3. **Integration**: Works with our existing CircleCI setup?
4. **Support**: What's the support SLA?

## Feedback on Messaging
- "Talk more about scaling - that's our biggest pain"
- Compliance angle really resonated
- Want to see specific FinTech customer examples
- Suggested webinar topic: "Scaling DevOps from 15 to 150 engineers"

## Objections
- Concerned about adding another tool to the stack
- Sophie worried about another migration project (just migrated 6 months ago)
- Price point higher than current CircleCI spend

## Next Steps
- Send compliance documentation and certifications
- Demo custom workflow configuration
- Connect them with FinTech customer for reference call
- Discuss migration support and timeline

## Quotes
> "We're at an inflection point. Either we fix our deployment process now, or we'll be drowning in 6 months." - Raj

> "I need a solution that scales without me becoming a bottleneck." - Sophie

## Deal Potential
🟡 **MEDIUM-HIGH** - Strong need, but price sensitivity and migration concerns
