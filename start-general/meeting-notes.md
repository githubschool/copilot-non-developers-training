## Meeting Objective
Review competitive analysis of Warby Parker's positioning and determine strategic recommendations for Zenni Optical's market positioning and value proposition refinement.

---

## Key Discussion Points

### 1. Competitive Landscape Overview

**Warby Parker's Position:**
- Starting price: $95 (vs. our $6.95-$7)
- Targeting "affordable premium" segment with emphasis on style, brand experience, and omnichannel presence
- 200+ retail locations for fittings, adjustments, and eye exams
- Strong brand identity around social impact ("Buy a Pair, Give a Pair")
- Integrated insurance benefit checking
- Home Try-On program + AR virtual try-on

**Zenni's Current Position:**
- Price leadership:  85-90% cheaper than Warby Parker on basic frames
- Average order value: ~$40 vs. Warby's $95-$145
- 4,000+ frame selection (vs. Warby's curated smaller collection)
- Online-only distribution
- Virtual try-on tool (currently iOS only)

**Sarah (Marketing):** "We're competing in different segments, but there's customer overlap we're not capturing.  Some of our customers might trade up if we had a premium offering; some of Warby's price-sensitive customers might come to us if we solved their confidence concerns."

---

### 2. Customer Pain Points We're Not Addressing

**Discussion identified 7 key gaps:**

#### Gap #1: Pre-Purchase Confidence
- **Issue:** No physical try-on option; customers hesitant to buy glasses sight unseen
- **Warby's solution:** Free 5-frame Home Try-On + retail stores
- **Our current state:** Virtual try-on only (limited to iOS app)

**David (CX):** "Our return data shows 18% of first-time buyers return glasses due to fit/style concerns.  Repeat customers only have 6% returns. There's a trust barrier for new customers."

**Action:** Taylor to pull data on first-time buyer conversion vs. repeat buyers; segment by price point

#### Gap #2: Brand Perception & Quality Concerns
- **Issue:** Ultra-low prices may signal "cheap" rather than "value"
- **Warby's solution:** Premium brand positioning, curated design, limited collections
- **Our current state:** 4,000+ options can feel overwhelming; brand identity = "affordable" not "stylish"

**Marcus (Product):** "We have great quality frames in the $40-80 range that could compete with Warby on style. We're just not surfacing them effectively."

**Jennifer (E-commerce):** "Choice overload is real. Our A/B tests show that curated landing pages convert 23% better than our full catalog pages."

#### Gap #3: Post-Purchase Support
- **Issue:** No physical locations for adjustments, repairs, or fitting help
- **Warby's solution:** 200+ retail stores with free adjustments
- **Our current state:** Customers DIY or visit local opticians (often paying $15-30)

**Jordan (Biz Dev):** "We've had inquiries from regional optical chains about partnership opportunities. Worth exploring?"

#### Gap #4: Insurance Integration
- **Issue:** Insurance benefit checking not prominent in our experience
- **Warby's solution:** Seamless insurance integration during checkout
- **Our current state:** We accept FSA/HSA but don't highlight it

**Sarah:** "We're leaving money on the table.  Customers with vision benefits might not realize they can use them with us."

#### Gap #5: Emotional Connection & Purpose
- **Issue:** Brand lacks emotional resonance beyond price savings
- **Warby's solution:** "Buy a Pair, Give a Pair" as core brand identity
- **Our current state:** We do charitable work but don't highlight it

**Alex (Brand Strategy):** "Our charitable initiatives are buried on the site. We donated 50,000 pairs last year through vision screenings. That's a story we should tell."

#### Gap #6: Integrated Eye Care
- **Issue:** Not a one-stop-shop; customers need prescriptions before shopping
- **Warby's solution:** In-store eye exams and appointment booking
- **Our current state:** Assume customers have prescriptions

**Marcus:** "Telehealth eye exams are getting better.  Could be a partnership opportunity rather than building in-house."

#### Gap #7: Personalization & Curation
- **Issue:** 4,000+ options create decision paralysis
- **Warby's solution:** Style quiz, Advisor tool, curated collections
- **Our current state:** Filtering by attributes but no guided shopping

---

### 3. Strategic Positioning Options Discussed

The team reviewed four potential strategic directions:

#### Option A: Double Down on Value Leadership
**Positioning:** "Premium quality at breakthrough prices—why pay more?"

**Pros:**
- Plays to core strength
- Clear differentiation
- Protects market share in budget segment

**Cons:**
- Ceiling on revenue growth
- Doesn't capture mid-tier customers
- Brand perception challenges remain

**Sarah:** "This is the safe play, but are we leaving growth on the table?"

---

#### Option B: Segmented Brand Strategy ⭐ (Team consensus favorite)
**Positioning:** "Glasses for every lifestyle and budget"

**Key elements:**
- Launch premium tier: "Zenni Select" or "Zenni Studio" ($60-120 curated designer-style frames)
- Maintain core value line ($7-40 basics)
- Create lifestyle collections (Athletic, Professional, Eco-Friendly, Kids)
- Differentiated messaging by tier

**Pros:**
- Captures multiple customer segments
- Doesn't abandon core value proposition
- Creates trade-up path for existing customers
- Competes more directly with Warby's mid-tier positioning

**Cons:**
- Risk of brand dilution
- Requires separate marketing investments
- Need to manage cannibalization

**Marcus:** "We already have the inventory in this price range. It's more about how we merchandise and market it."

**Jennifer:** "This lets us test the premium market without betting the farm.  Start small with 100 curated frames, measure response, scale if it works."

---

#### Option C: Hybrid Experience (Add Physical Touchpoints)
**Positioning:** "Online prices, offline confidence"

**Key elements:**
- Partner with optical retailers for adjustments
- Pop-up try-on events in major cities
- Virtual fitting assistant (AI + video consultation)
- "Fit Guarantee" program

**Pros:**
- Addresses biggest customer pain point (try-before-buy confidence)
- Differentiates from pure online competitors
- Doesn't require massive capital investment (partnerships vs. owned stores)

**Cons:**
- Operationally complex
- Partnership economics unclear
- May dilute pure online efficiency

**Jordan:** "I can have partnership proposals from 3 regional chains by end of Q1. Worth exploring in parallel with other strategies."

---

#### Option D: Emphasize Accessibility & Inclusion
**Positioning:** "Vision care for everyone—no exceptions"

**Key elements:**
- Mission-driven brand identity around accessibility
- Amplify charitable work and impact stories
- Payment plans ("$2/month for progressives")
- Partner with vision care nonprofits

**Pros:**
- Authentic to our price positioning
- Emotional brand connection
- Resonates with socially conscious consumers

**Cons:**
- May reinforce "cheap" perception
- Limits premium tier opportunities
- Purpose-washing risk if not authentic

**Alex:** "This could be a powerful secondary message regardless of which option we choose. It shouldn't be either/or."

---

### 4. Decisions & Recommendations

**DECISION:** Move forward with **Option B (Segmented Brand Strategy)** as primary approach, with elements of Options C and D integrated.

**Rationale:**
- Captures the most growth opportunity without abandoning core value prop
- Leverages existing inventory and capabilities
- Can be tested and scaled incrementally
- Addresses multiple customer pain points simultaneously

**Sarah:** "We position this as an evolution, not a pivot. We're still Zenni—unbeatable prices—but now with options for every need."

## Open Questions / Parking Lot

1. **Cannibalization risk:** If we promote premium frames, do we lose volume on $7-20 basic frames?  What's the net revenue impact? 
   - *Owner:  Taylor (Analytics) - Model scenarios by Feb 15*

2. **Brand architecture:** Do we need a sub-brand for premium ("Zenni Select") or keep it all under Zenni?
   - *Owner: Alex (Brand Strategy) - Recommend by Feb 15*

3. **Margin implications:** What are the margin profiles at different price tiers?  Can we maintain profitability with more premium offerings?
   - *Owner: Marcus (Product) + Finance - Analysis by Feb 10*

4. **Partnership economics:** What would optical chain partnerships cost vs. building our own network?
   - *Owner: Jordan (Biz Dev) - Financial modeling by Feb 28*

5. **International considerations:** Does this strategy work globally or just US market?
   - *Owner: Sarah (Marketing) - Defer to Q2 planning*

## Key Quotes from Meeting

**Sarah (Marketing):** *"We're not trying to become Warby Parker. We're trying to be Zenni for more occasions and more customers."*

**Marcus (Product):** *"We've been hiding our best frames in a sea of options. Let's curate the good stuff and let it shine."*
